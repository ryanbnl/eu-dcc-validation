# New Features and Improvements

## Support multiple test rounds

- [] Update the welcome screen to have a dropdown of test rounds.
- [] Use a different data source per test round.
- [] Only load data when a round is selected.
- [] NO round selected by default.

This starts by adding a share service with a list of rounds. That is then the source for the dropdown on the Welcome screen.

## Validation clock

- [] One clock per test round
- [] Display clock on the screen prominently

## Validation response

- [] Provide dropdown of results including error reason
- [] "Error - Other" displays free text box
- [] "Invalid - Other" displays free text box
- [] ? Warn about the dates?

## Country list (sidebar)

- [] Sort alphabetically
- [] Filter by status, as a button, which rotates (ALL > TODO > VALID > INVALID > ERROR > loop)

## General

- [] Fix result button on to 720P screen with no scrolling
- [] Test + tweak with iPad resolution
